I created this game because I like cricket and am playing at a high level. I'm quite basic in my understanding of code and not that big of an expert so all I know how to do is use OOP to make my games. Some bugs that you may occur is the balancing of the scoring ratio between the two teams. To play the game you need some basic knowledge in cricket for example: when you get a bouncer you play a pull shot. Sometimes a defence shot can also get runs. I made it like this because it can simulate a nick from the bat. NOTE: I'M ACKNOLWEDGING THE HELP OF COPILOT WHICH ONLY HELPED ME WITH SPEED. ONLY HELPED ABOUT 15%
